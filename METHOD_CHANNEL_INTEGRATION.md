# Android Host App - Method Channel Integration

This Android host app demonstrates how to integrate with the Flutter module using method channels for screen navigation and back handling.

## Features Added

### 1. Updated MainActivity
- **Two buttons**: One for opening the main Tetris game, another for opening the About screen directly
- **Screen parameter passing**: Passes the target screen name to FlutterActivity
- **Modern UI**: Updated layout with emojis and better descriptions

### 2. Enhanced FlutterActivity
- **Method Channel Integration**: Full bidirectional communication with Flutter
- **Screen Navigation**: Can open specific screens in Flutter based on Android intent
- **Back Navigation Handling**: Receives back navigation events from Flutter
- **Custom Event Support**: Can receive game events (scores, achievements, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging

### 3. Method Channel Features
- **Screen Navigation**: `navigateToScreen` method to open specific Flutter screens
- **Back Navigation Events**: `onBackNavigation` to handle Flutter back button presses
- **Screen Change Tracking**: `onScreenChanged` to track which screen user is on
- **Custom Events**: `onCustomEvent` for game-specific events

## How to Test

### 1. Build and Run
```bash
# Make sure Flutter module is built first
cd /path/to/flutter_module_example
flutter build aar

# Then build and run Android app
cd /path/to/android_host_app
./gradlew build
./gradlew installDebug
```

### 2. Test Navigation
1. **Open Tetris Game**: Tap "üéÆ Open Tetris Game" ‚Üí Opens main game screen
2. **Open About Screen**: Tap "‚ÑπÔ∏è Open About Screen" ‚Üí Opens about screen directly
3. **Back Navigation**: Press back in Flutter ‚Üí Should return to Android app

### 3. Check Logs
Use Android Studio Logcat or adb to view logs:
```bash
adb logcat | grep FlutterActivity
```

Expected log messages:
- `Opening Flutter module with screen: main/about`
- `Navigation to [screen] successful`
- `Back navigation from screen: [screen]`
- `Screen changed to: [screen]`

## Method Channel Communication

### Android ‚Üí Flutter
```kotlin
// Navigate to specific screen
methodChannel?.invokeMethod("navigateToScreen", mapOf(
    "screenName" to "about",
    "params" to null
))
```

### Flutter ‚Üí Android
```dart
// Send back navigation event
await MethodChannelService.instance.sendBackNavigation(
  fromScreen: MethodChannelService.SCREEN_MAIN,
);

// Send custom game event
await MethodChannelService.instance.sendCustomEvent(
  eventName: 'game_score_updated',
  data: {'score': 1500, 'level': 3},
);
```

## Screen Flow

```
Android MainActivity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Button: "Open Tetris Game" ‚Üí FlutterActivity(screen=main)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Button: "Open About Screen" ‚Üí FlutterActivity(screen=about)

FlutterActivity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Receives screen parameter from Intent
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sets up Method Channel
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Navigates Flutter to specified screen
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Handles back navigation events
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Method Channel Not Working
- Check Flutter module is properly built with method channel code
- Verify channel name matches: `flutter_module_example/navigation`
- Check logs for method channel initialization

### 2. Navigation Not Working
- Ensure Flutter module has the updated method channel service
- Check if screen names match exactly: `main`, `about`, `game`
- Verify Flutter routes are properly set up

### 3. Back Navigation Issues
- Check PopScope implementation in Flutter screens
- Verify method channel callbacks are properly handled
- Test with both Flutter back button and Android back button

## Next Steps

1. **Add Game Events**: Implement score tracking, achievements
2. **Analytics Integration**: Track screen views and user interactions
3. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and fallbacks
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for method channel communication

## Method Channel Events

### Events Flutter Sends to Android:
- `onBackNavigation`: When user presses back
- `onScreenChanged`: When screen changes
- `onCustomEvent`: Game events, scores, etc.

### Methods Android Calls on Flutter:
- `navigateToScreen`: Navigate to specific screen
- `getCurrentScreen`: Get current screen name

This implementation provides a solid foundation for Flutter-Android integration with proper navigation and communication.
